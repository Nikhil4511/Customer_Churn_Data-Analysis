## 📉 Customer Churn Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn behavior to identify key factors that influence whether a customer stays with or leaves a company.
Using Python and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the project uncovers patterns related to customer demographics, services, billing, and contract details that contribute to churn.

The insights from this analysis can help businesses reduce churn, improve customer retention, and increase revenue.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand churn vs non-churn customer distribution

- Identify key features contributing to customer churn

- Analyze churn based on contract type, payment method, tenure, and services

- Perform EDA and feature-level insights

- Prepare data for future machine learning models

## 📊 Dataset Information

- File Name: Customer Churn.csv

- Type: CSV

- Target Variable: Churn (Yes / No)

## 🧾 Column Overview

- The dataset includes customer information such as:

- Customer demographics

- Account information

- Services subscribed

- Billing and payment details

- Churn status

- Key Features

- gender

- SeniorCitizen

- tenure

- Contract

- MonthlyCharges

- TotalCharges

- PaymentMethod

- InternetService

- Churn

## 📈 Key Insights

- Customers with month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate

- Short-tenure customers are more likely to churn

- Higher monthly charges increase churn probability

- Customers using electronic check payment churn more frequently

- Long-term contracts significantly reduce churn

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- Python

- Pandas & NumPy – Data manipulation

- Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

- Jupyter Notebook – Analysis & reporting

## 📊 Analysis Performed
